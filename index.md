> I am a remote Ruby on Rails developer with 5+ years of experience based in Rosario, Argentina. I am able to build from scratch any project you want in an agile environment, integrate it with a front-end framework, deploy it and maintain it on the cloud. Always looking for quality and fast delivery using automatic testing and CI technologies. I take proactive action in every project suggesting architectural solutions and helping clarifying partial or undefined features.

# Experience

### Rails Dev at IT Crowd Argentina (Feb. 2019 - Present)

I developed and deployed a resources search engine on AWS using Elasticsearch, with multi-level user roles features, asynchronous user notifications and detailed usage charts and statistics in a remote and agile team.


### Rails Dev at Fontela Cristales (Feb. 2014 - Present)  
[www.fontela.com.ar](http://www.fontela.com.ar)  

I developed a glass manufacture system from scratch in order to track product manufacturing through multiple factory stages making possible having real time order statuses, completion percentage and centralized information for workers, administrative staff and management.

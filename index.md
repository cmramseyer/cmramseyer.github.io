# Experience

### Rails Dev at MajorKey Technologies (Apr. 2021 - Present)  
[www.majorkeytech.com](http://www.majorkeytech.com)  

Working for Atria Wealth Solutions. Advisor Financial Dashboard app.  
My role was Senior Ruby dev, but acted as Lead Ruby dev.  
Onboarding of new members. Working with Product Owners in Backlog, identifying feasibility and early lack of definition. Helped with Epic stories and new features: splitting them into smaller parts, estimation, and defining a dev strategy to start working as soon as possible with complete information.  
Took the lead coordinating work when a new feature or bug affects multiple microservices/systems and many teams were involved.  
Helped devs identifying production deployment risks when they were working on their tasks.  
Wrote team process guidelines for PR Reviews, Sprint Groomings, and the approach and recommendations to tackle complex tasks.  
Worked on several performance optimization tasks on a big Postges database (~2.5TB). Refactored data into materialized views when it was necessary.  


### Rails Dev at IT Crowd Argentina (Feb. 2019 - Mar. 2021)  
[www.itcrowdarg.com](http://www.itcrowdarg.com)  

Developed and deployed a resources search engine on AWS EC2 using Elasticsearch, with multi-level user roles features, asynchronous user notifications and detailed usage charts and statistics in a remote and agile team.  
Built a chatbot with AWS Lex.
Took an active role suggesting changes and features alternatives because we did not have a Business Analyst role, and the Product Owner did not have former tech projects experience.


### Rails Dev at Fontela Cristales (Feb. 2014 - Jan. 2019)  
[www.fontela.com.ar](http://www.fontela.com.ar)  

Developed a glass windows manufacture system from scratch in order to track product manufacturing through multiple factory stages making possible having real time order statuses, completion percentage and centralized information for workers, administrative staff and management.  
Integrated the application with many cutting glass system softwares (Opty-Way) and billing system (Tango Gestion).
